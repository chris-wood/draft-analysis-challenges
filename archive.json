      "body": "Publication bas influences project choice as well as project exploration. That is, it might influence the problem statements that people might choose to work on, and then might influence the way in which they explore the solution space. In practice, what we often need is analysis that gives us confidence in a well-defined solution that was chosen for specific reasons. For example, we had analysis done for blind RSA because it was used for Privacy Pass, whereas publication bias sort of led to a flurry of related papers that solved the problem with different constraints and tradeoffs in mind.

          "body": "Proposed text:\r\n\r\nPublication bias is real and can adversely impede meaningful research and analysis on specifications and technologies being developed in the IETF. In particular, publication bias can influence the specifications that receive analysis, as well as related work and research on alternative solutions to problems those specifications aim to solve. Publication bias matters in practice because publications can have meaningful impacts on individuals' careers. For example, publishing a paper might be an incentive for young researchers who are still establishing themselves in the community, and publishing bias influences what those researchers might choose to work on.\r\n\r\nIn general, publication bias means that there is little incentive to work on problems that may seem uninteresting \"overly simple\" protocols, including those that seem to be \"obviously correct.\" Even for those problems that are deemed worthy of analysis, publication bias can result in solutions that may not be usable or deployable in practice due to different tradeoffs or requirements. This is not to say that research into alternative solutions is not desired; Indeed, research of this type offers new insights into possible solutions that may not have been previously considered. However, in practice, this research may not have immediate impact, since it does not necessarily cover the specification that actually needs analysis.\r\n\r\nWe need to acknowledge the reality of publication bias and work to overcome it. Some options for overcoming this bias through incentives are below:\r\n\r\n- Establishing a venue for more easily publishing formal analysis without compromising on the quality of peer review. Such venue should make clear that publishing analysis of any type is appropriate, including formal models, pen and paper proofs, and so on. \r\n- Making the potential impact of analysis for emerging specifications that are being developed and shipped more clear. A clear impact statement, e.g., evidence that analysis supports shipping software, may help overcome publication bias that adversely influences project selection. Publishing a paper might also be an incentive to help validate work in a community, e.g., by demonstrating that a research tool being developed has a positive influence on the community.\r\n- Making problem statements and real world requirements more clear. This should help scope the solution space and focus analysis on specifications and software that is shipping. In motivating work making these problem statements and their requirements clear, we should strive to encourage research outside the constraints of these real world requirements. \r\n- Provide financial support. This can come in the form of grants for individual researchers to work on a problem, financial aid delivered to a community or project to which the researcher belongs or contributes, or something else. Regardless of the way that the aid is delivered, financial support empowers researchers to do work that they might not otherwise be able to justify amongst competing priorities.\r\n\r\n",
